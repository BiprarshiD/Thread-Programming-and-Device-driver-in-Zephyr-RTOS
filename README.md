# Thread-Programming-and-Device-driver-in-Zephyr-RTOS
In this project, we make device drivers for HC-Sr04 ultrasonic sensor and 24FC256 EEPROM chip in Zephyr RTOS on Intel Galileo board. The user is provided with shell module interface to interact with the system and take readings, store them in EEPROM as well as display values stored in the memory.
